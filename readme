[Preparation for using the SDK]
If you use this SDK, please replace file IpasspayConfig-dist.php in directory src/IpasspayChannel/config with file IpasspayConfig.php, then configure your own merchant portal parameters in it.
Tips: 1.In Linux, the command to replace the file is: cp IpasspayConfig-dist.php IpasspayConfig.php
      2.The IpasspayConfig.php file will not be changed if you run command "composer update ipasspay/sdk-en"

3.The SDK will process the response data, and you can directly obtain the response data in the form of array through the corresponding method.
