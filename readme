[Preparation for using the SDK]
If you use this SDK, please replace file IpasspayConfig-dist.php in directory src/IpasspayChannel/config with file IpasspayConfig.php, then configure your own merchant portal parameters in it.
Tips: 1.In Linux, the command to replace the file is: cp IpasspayConfig-dist.php IpasspayConfig.php
      2.The IpasspayConfig.php file will not be changed if you run command "composer update ipasspay/sdk-en"

[Instructions for using the SDK]
1.By the SDK, you will simply create the request data according the API documentation, use the demo as needed, and communicate with iPasspay.
2.By the SDK, there's no need to worry about timestamp, signatures, and verification, the SDK is already integrated, it can be called directly to complete encryption, verification and communication.
3.The SDK will process the response data, and you can directly obtain the response data in the form of array through the corresponding method.
4.The SDK will pre-judge parameters before initiating a request to reduce invalid server network overhead and facilitate the discovery of errors during integration.
5.It is suggested that merchants with technical ability to use SDK package should use it as far as possible. The SDK package supports PHP5.6 to PHP8.1.
